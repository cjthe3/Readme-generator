#readme generator is exactly how it sounds. its a program that generates a custom readme based on user input in the terminal.

#to use open the develop folder in the terminal and type "node index".js" and follow the instructions

#this program was made by Cannon Stephens in order to generate a custom readme

#currently their is nothing further in development and we are accepting no further help/ideas to improve the product

#if this program is not working correctly feel free to reach out to "cannonbombtv@gmail.com" and ask for any help/questions
